# Jack Welpott - Fine Art Photography

Commissioned Website for Fine Art Photographer Jack Welpott. DOM manipulation for responsive design and components were completed using Jquery. Contact form submissions using AJAX were handled with Jquery and a PHP Mailer. To gain a better understanding of popular CSS Frameworks I completed styling using mainly Bootstrap. Image editing was completed using photoshop.
